    My name is Patrick Leaban, but just call me Patrick because blegh; why not?
      I was born on the 22nd of November, 2010 on the city of Las Pinas because yes!
      Im currently 14 years old, but ill turn 15 next month which is both fun and nerve-wracking.
      I currently have a hobby of editing and making fan-edits of whatever my interests are hehe!
    </p>
    <p>
        If you were to ask me what I wanna do when I  grow up it'll probably
        a blur because everything is unexpected, but I do hope to become a fashion designer
        or a veterinarian when I grow up; though i prefer not to think too much of it
        because anything could happen honestly.

            <p>I have quite the common interests in a way? in general I like games and watching
                shows, whether it'll be animated or not. I am an avid genshin impact player
                and the theme for this part is flins! one of their most recent characters! i also
                LOVE geography and watch an old and still ongoing anime called hetalia which is both
                fun and interesting! i also like anything regarding the 2010 era because the clothing 
                and shows back then were honestly more interesting..

            <p>I have tons of friends that I condsider precious to me, I will forever wish for them
                to be by my side, and even if we dont stay long enough, ill forever wish good health and 
                luck towards them. They've been with me through thick and thin and I will never stop
                appreciating them. They helped me improve myself and my academics even when it was clear
                im slowly downgrading, but even then they have never let me go and because of that I will 
                forever shower them with my true personality and comfort, I want them to know that if they 
                ever need someone to defend them (whether it'll be verbal or physical hehe) I will ALWAYS
                be there!

            <p>I absolutely LOVE when people have the same interests as me or at least respects what I like!
                I love food and I also love sleeping, I love Genshin Impact and Drag Art, I also REALLY love 
                both men and women (bisexual) and I appreciate people who are not afraid to speak against
                evil or corrupt things.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hate anyone who doesn't have any sort of basic human decency (eg. shaming someone for their 
                interests, saying racial slurs, no common sense and/or etiquette) I hate homophobes, xenophobes,
                racists, ableist, and zionist people. I dont like fatshamers nor do I appreciate anyone who thinks
                one thing is too childish to be used at a certain age. Its just basic morals.

            <p> You can mostly find me on Facebook with the name of Patrick Leaban, though my account is locked
                and im very picky on who to accept or not accept. Im also found on instagram! with the username of
                6723.mp4; but then again, its private and I am very wary on who to accept there, as long as I know who
                you are, you'll get in! I am also found on twitter and discord but i barely use them both so it is 
                much better to reach out to me at facebook or instagram! I honestly have a lot of time on my hands
                because I genuinely can't let go of my phone so you dont have to worry about long time before a response!
                Im also open to make new friends and talk about what ever you may want to talk about; personal or
                casual!
